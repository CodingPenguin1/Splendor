# Splendor

Doing research on and potentially making an AI for the board game Splendor

[About the game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor)
[Rules](./splendor_rulebook.pdf)

Inspiration: I cannot for the life of me figure out how much strategy vs luck there is to the game because no matter what strategy I do or anyone else does everyone seems to always be in pretty close competition for the win
